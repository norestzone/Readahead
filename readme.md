# READAHEAD

A platform where users create a profile to house their online bookshelf! Users login and are able to search an extensive library to find and add books to categories like Currently Reading, Reading List, and Favorites. Users can also share their views on a book theyâ€™ve read by engaging in a book's conversation thread.

## User Experience

A user creates an account where they are able to log in and are then directed to their user profile.

While on their profile page a user can utilize the Find a Book feature by entering search terms that include isbn, title, author, or publisher. Once the search is submitted, results are shown and a user is able to select a title to view individual book details.

Within an individual book's details, a user can add the title to their profile by choosing Currently Reading, Add to Reading List, and Add to Favorites. The user is also able to create, edit, and delete their comment(s) on the book and read what other users have to say.

## Planning & Building
1. Inital project planning went well, however met many obstacles when building database. ERD needed to be restructed multiple times and wireframes needed adjustments to meet functionality requirements.
2. Ideally wanted to stub out all routes in the beginning, but found it was easier to add routes as functional features were added for testing purposes.
3. API Key had a slightly different implementation method which required multiple attempts.
4. User button feature(s) was the most time consuming of project tasks, had issues calling specific information from database.

## Final Thoughts
This project was fun to conceptualize and build out despite the many challenges I encountered. I was able to refer back to what we've learned in this unit while expanding my understanding of the subject matter and learning new ways of implementation.

My main takeway from this project is to plan ERDs and wireframing appropriately and ensure it will meet project goals in order to avoid future complications if possible.
